This react-app is used to show how refactoring arrays to use React's `useMemo` hook will speed up the rendering of content.

The render time for this app was measured using [React dev tools in Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en).

Some things worth noting:
- Render time varies based on the browser
- Render time varies based on the hardware
- Render time varies based on other processes / memory available
- There is a tradeoff between computation and memory. We don't know where the line is, but eventually, useMemo could potentially become a memory hog
- This test example may not effectively represent real app performance scenarios
- Overhead may be caused by the profiler
- Overhead may be caused by create-react-app in `dev` instead of `release` mode
