This react-app is used to show how refactoring arrays to use React's `useMemo` hook will speed up the rendering of content.

The render time for this app was measured using [React dev tools in Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en).


The average render time (when rendering 200 items) was
- With inline array mapping: ~7 milliseconds
- With useMemo: ~1.3 milliseconds
